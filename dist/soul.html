It should be facing left if you're sliding with your right foot or right if you're sliding with your left foot. Your sliding foot should be on its inside edge and at a 90 degree angle to the rolling foot.</p></section><section class="gapl"><h3>Exercise 1: Stationary</h3><p class="gap">The goal of this exercise is to practice the form and start troubleshooting some of the issues you will face. With your skates on, go on the grass and, without rolling, practice getting into the position.</p><h4>Steps:</h4><ol class="gap"><li>Bend your knees</li><li>Shift your body weight to your back foot</li><li>Put your front foot on its inside edge</li><li>Push your front foot in a soul slide position</li></ol><p>During this exercise your focus will be to make sure your weight really is over your back foot.</p></section><section class="gapl"><h3>Exercise 2: Wet</h3><p class="gap">Practicing on wet surfaces will allow you to ease into the slide and let you focus on your form rather than fighting to get your foot to slide. If you live in a desert and it never rains you can wax the surface you're skating on with a candle.</p><h4>Steps:</h4><ol class="gap"><li>Skate forward at jogging speed</li><li>Bend your knees</li><li>Shift your body weight to your back foot</li><li>Put your front foot on its inside edge</li><li>Push your front foot in a soul slide position</li></ol><p>During this exercise you need to focus on having your weight over your rolling foot as well as focusing on your form. Your balance will be put to the test and a good form will be what you need.</p></section><section class="gap"><h3>Exercise 3: Dry</h3><p>At this stage you have everything you need. The challenge will be to get your foot to slide. A slight downhill might help. You might need to practice for a little while to get used to the grip and before you manage to get your foot to slide.</p></section><section><h3>Troubleshooting</h3><h4>Your front foot grips and you only end up turning.</h4><p>This is likely due to having too much weight on the sliding foot. Redo exercise 1 and try to lift the sliding foot without losing balance.</p><h4>Your front foot grips and you're tripping over it.</h4><p>This happens when you are not enough on the edge of your sliding foot. Try pushing on the inside edge of your foot inside your skates. Bending your knee toward the inside does this naturally.</p><h4>You manage to slide but your slide curves.</h4><p>This is due to your back foot turning slightly as you start the slide. Try having the weight on the front of the foot of your rolling foot.</p></section><section class="gapl"><h3>Complementary tricks</h3><p>Before learning the soul slide it is recommended to learn the power slide, it is the first slide that will allow you to get used to the feeling of sliding.</p><p>After learning the soul slide, if you want to learn to stop try learning the magic slide (recommended) or the parallel slide. Your body should already be in position and the transition to magic or parallel is done simply by turning the back foot sideway. If you're into freestyle try learning the soul toe and fakie soul toe.</p></section><a class="cta" href="../classes.html">Our Classes</a><div class="fb-like" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/beskatin" data-layout="button" data-action="like" data-show-faces="false" data-share="true" data-colorscheme="dark"></div></div></article><script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
